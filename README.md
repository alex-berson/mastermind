## Description

**Mastermind**, also known as **Codebreaker**, is a classic game of logic and deduction. The object of the game is to solve a secret code consisting of four colored pegs by making guesses and following the hints. After each guess, the player receives feedback: _a black peg_ means the player has a correct color in the correct position. _A white peg_ means the player has a correct color in the wrong position.
